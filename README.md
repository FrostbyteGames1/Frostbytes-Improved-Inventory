# Frostbyte's Improved Inventory (Fabric)

**Overview:**

This mod adds new behaviors to Minecraft's inventory and HUD, each with their own keybinds.

1. Slot Cycle: Allows the player to cycle the active hotbar slot with a different item in the same column. 
2. Durability Display: Displays the durability of equipped armor on the screen.
3. Stack Refill: Repopulates stacks of items in the hotbar with matching ones from the inventory.
4. Tool Selection: Automatically switchs to the most effective tool for the targeted block or entity.

**Notes:**

- I am not currently planning on adding more content to this mod. However, feel free to suggest new behaviors through GitHub's feature request system, and I may consider adding them.

**FAQs:**

- *Will this be updated to 1.x.x?* - Yes! I plan on updating this mod for as long as I can. Expect to wait a few weeks after major Minecraft updates for an updated version of this mod. There may be longer pauses between minor versions depending on how busy I am.
- *Will you make a Forge version?* - No. I don't make Forge mods, but feel free to make your own (unofficial) port as long as you credit me for any code borrowed from this mod.
- *Can I use this in my mod pack?* - Yes! I made this mod for people to use!
